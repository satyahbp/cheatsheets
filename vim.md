# Vim Cheat Sheet
This is a cheat sheet for the vim things I learn over time from various sources.

### Cursor Navigation
Left: `h` <br>
Down: `j` <br>
Up: `k` <br>
Right: `l` <br>
Beginning of the file: `gg` <br>
End of the file: `G` <br>

### Undo and Redo
Undo: `u` <br>
Redo: `Ctrl + r` <br>
Doing 3 undo at once: `3u` <br>
Doing 3 undo at once: `3Ctrl + r` <br>

### Cut Action
Use: `d + <any suffix>` <br>
Deleting the current line: `dd` <br>
Cutting 3 lines down from the current position: `d3 + down_arrow_key` <br>
Cutting till the end of the file from current position: `dG` <br>
Deleting all lines: `gg + dG` <br>
